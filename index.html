            <p class = "details">
                In 2020, I started learning web development initially from a free online source like youtube, scrimba. Then, I came across <span class = "highlight">Web Devlopment for Everybody</span> by UMICH on Coursera which is a wonderful course for the novice as the focus is not only on concepts but also hands-on learning taught by <span class = "highlight">Dr. Collen Van Lent</span>. There are programming assignments along with quiz at end of each week, helps in the implementation of what we did during the week. You can go through the portfolio section in which I've included many of my web development projects.

            <p class = "details">
                During the end semester, I started my training at <span class = "highlight">CSIO</span> Chandigarh under Dr Amitabha Das and Dr Satbir sir. I worked on amazing <span class = "highlight">deep learning</span> and <span class = "highlight">computer vision</span> projects.  I started my internship by starting with basic image processing and learning super-resolution and looked a little bit into GANs(as it can be used for creating a super-resolution image). I used <span class = "highlight">YOLO v3</span> for analyzing the real-time Chandigarh traffic data, to identify the vehicles apart from animals and humans and then classify the vehicle into different categories(Bus, Car, Bike, Tempo). It helped to gain insights into Computer Vision and thorough understanding of <span class = "highlight">Convolution Neural Network</span>.

            <p class = "details">
                During the Summer of 2018, I did my internship at <span class = "highlight">LBD Robotics</span>, Pitampura under Mayank sir.I
                started by learning various pcb terminologies and saftey standards like FR4 then we learnt the current scenario of <span class = "highlight">PCB manufacturing</span> in India and how heavily our supply chain is depended on China. In later weeks, I learnt <span class = "highlight">PCB designing</span> and essential components of PCB manufacturing. I worked on Arduino UNO PCB design for a month using Altium software.

                During the Summer of 2017, I did my training at <span class = "highlight">3ST Technologies</span>, Noida. I'd a interest in robotics so what better than to start learning how to play with <span class = "highlight">AVR and arduino</span>. During the course I worked on various <span class = "highlight">peripheral devices</span> like actuator, LED, Motor, sensors, bluetooth, WIFI, RFID card reader, gyroscopes and more.. I worked using embedded C on AVR and arduino has its own programming language similar to c/c++. I also learned basic <span class = "highlight">linux</span> and in the end I submitted LFR (<span class = "highlight">Line Following Robot</span>) as my project(at that time I'd designed various programs like wall detection, avoiding fall and so on in it as well).

                During the Summer of 2016, I started my training at <span class = "highlight">Aedifico</span>, Shakarpur(Laxmi Nagar,Delhi). I
                joined with 3 of my friends and did this as group training. We started with basic of <span class = "highlight">MATLAB</span> and then covered GUI, Simulink(as we all were from ECE background), Image processing toolbox.
                We made a small group project of <span class = "highlight">Object identification</span> in real-time using edge detection algorithm ofcourse we did many small projects as well.
